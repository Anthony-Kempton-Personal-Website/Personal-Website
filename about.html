	<h2>Tennis</h2>
	<p>Tennis is one of my favorite sports. I love the feeling of hitting a perfect serve. It's also a great way to stay active and get some exercise. I try to play at least once a week, and sometimes I even compete in local tournaments. It's a lot of fun!</p>

	<h2>Manga Collecting</h2>
	<p>I've been collecting manga for a few years now, and I absolutely love it. I enjoy reading about different characters and storylines, and the artwork is always so impressive. Plus, there's a huge community of manga fans out there, and it's fun to share recommendations and talk about our favorite series. I have a whole bookshelf dedicated to my manga collection, and I'm always looking for new additions.</p>

	<h2>Drum Setting</h2>
	<p>I've been playing drums for a while, and I recently got really into drum setting. It's amazing how much of a difference the placement of each drum and cymbal can make in the overall sound. I've spent hours tinkering with my set up, trying different combinations and seeing what works best. It's a bit of an obsession, but it's worth it when I finally get everything just right.</p>
